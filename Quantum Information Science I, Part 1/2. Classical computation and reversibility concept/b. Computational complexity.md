AND gate
NOT gate

Boolean functions
  f(x0 .... xn-1) = 0 or 1
  f(x1,x2) = x1x2 -> AND
  f(x) = ~x -> NOT
  
Strong Church Turing thesis:
Any model of computation can be simulated on a probabilistic turing machine.
This simulation cost comes with at most a polynomial increase in the number of elementary operations required.

Decision Problem
Is m Prime? Primality
Factoring: Given composite integer m and  l<m, does m have a non-trivial factor <l? 

* If time is polynomial in the size of a question, we say that the problem is polynomial in complexity. -> P
* If yes instances of the problem are easily verified with the aid of the witness, problem -> NP
* If no instances of the problem are easily verified with the aid of the witness, problem ->CO-NP

P is not NP
