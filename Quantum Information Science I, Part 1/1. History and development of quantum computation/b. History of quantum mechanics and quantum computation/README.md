#### Quantum Mechanics 1900 - 1930
Einstein, Podolski, and Rosen(EPR) 1936 quantum mechanics(QM) is incomplete

Reason: two particles(EPR Pair), 

opposite momenta: -p, p

opposite positions: x, -x

Since Momenta and Position are conjugate variables. You cannot measure the position and the momentum of the same particle.(Something is hidden in this situation) -> Reason for Quantum Mechanics is Incomplete!

Schrodinger replied: These two particles are entangled, that's just the property that entangled particles have.

In 1964, Bell proved that no classical explaination for behavior of EPR Pair

In 19**, Aspect showed Bell's prediction is correct

In 1982, Herbert paper "FLASH First"(First Laser-Amplified Superluminal Hookup) faster than light communication using wired properties of Quantum Mechanics and EPR pairs. Unknown quantum states cannot be copied.

In 1982, "No-cloning theorem": A single unknown quantum state cannot be duplicated

In 1982/1980, Feynman, Manin: Very difficult to simulate QM requires ![2 pow n](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20%5Clarge%20%5E%7B2%5E%7Bn%7D%7D) steps for n particles. Quantum Computers would be faster.

In 1985, David Deutsch described QTM, asked is it good for classical computing?

In 1992, Deutsch and Josza, yes(sort of)

In 1993, Bernstein Vazirani

In 1993, Simon came up a problem that exponentially faster on a quantum computer(QC), which uses periodicity.

In 1994, Factoring and Discrete log on QC

In 1995, Lov Grover search algorithm, search a space of size n in ![root n](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi%7B300%7D%20%5Clarge%20%5E%7B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%7D) steps. -> We are going to do algorithm for this.
