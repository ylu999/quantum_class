### classical information and quantum information

#### Difference
Classical information can be copied at will, but Quantum can't


#### Similarities
All classical information is reducible to bits 0 and 1.
All processing of it can be done by simple logic gates(NOT,AND) acting on bits one and two at a time.
Bits and gates are fungible(idependent of physical embodiment), making possible Moore's law.

Quantum information is reducible to qubits
i.e. two-state quantum systems such as a photon's polarization or a spin-1/2 atom.
Quantum information processing is reducible to one- and two-qubit gate operations.
Qubits and quantum gates are fungible among different quantum systems.

#### Superposition Principle: The central principle of quantum mechanics
Between any two reliably distinguishable states of a physical system
(for example vertically and horizontally polarized single photons)
there are intermediate states(for example diagonal photons) that are not reliably distinguishable from either original state

The possible physical states correspond to directions in space not ordinary 3-dimensional space,
but an n-dimensional space where n is the system's maximum number of reliably distinguishable states.

Any direction is possible state, but two states are reliably distinguishable if&only if their directions are perpendicular

Measuring an unknown photon's polarization exactly is impossible(no measurement can yield more than 1 bit about it)
Cloning an unknown photon is impossible. (If either cloning or measuring were possible the other would be also)
If you try to amplify an unknown photon by sending it into an ideal laser, the output will be polluted by just enough noise.

#### Entanglement
It arises naturally during interaction, by virtue of the superposition principle
