# Computation must be robust against noise

Quantum has no clone theorem.

##Classical computer against noise, fault tolerance
1. Checkpointing
  
2. Error correcting codes
Map k bits to n bits, you can recover from some number of errors

3. Massive redundancy


Under no clone theorem, only No.2 Error correcting codes works with Quantum computing

*Computation

*Communication

*Memory

Error correcting codes on Computation has much more overhead than using them on Communication with and Memory with.
